// EngineUi.h - narrow PUBLIC engine surface: the in-game co-op session panel +
// status overlay. Carved out of Engine.h (Phase 5a domain split, 2026-07-19) so
// the UI root (Plugin.cpp) includes only what it needs and the sync/replication
// consumers stop transitively seeing the panel API.
//
// Like Engine.h this is a PUBLIC header: it declares only the SEH-guarded engine
// facade and must NEVER pull in a <kenshi/...> internal header - those live in
// the adapter (EngineInternal.h). Forward declarations only.

// via *st and the user's actions are handed BACK through the callbacks (the plugin
// root owns the session/config wiring). Main-thread only; SEH-guarded.
